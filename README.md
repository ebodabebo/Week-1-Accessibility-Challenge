# Code Refactor Starter Code


As a developer, refactoring starter code, I want to ensure that all CSS selectors and properties are streamlined and organized in a manner that satisfies semantic structure, and that the CSS file is appropriately commented.  

As a developer I want to ensure effective deployment of my work, a seamless user experience without faults or flaws, and correct storage and access of my work through Git Hub. 

As a developer I want to improve the accessibility of the site for users of all ranges of abilities by providing a richly descriptive and interactive user experience. 

I hope you enjoy my work.
